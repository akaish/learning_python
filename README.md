#Just learning python and some more things
I'm using Eclipse with PyDev and plan to learn Python (3.5 version). Actually, I would like learn how to use following stack: 
* Python
* Pyforms
* Django
* CSS
* JavaScript
I believe that this stack is awesome for developing both web and desktop applications from scratch. To achieve what I want I would code some learning tasks.

Right know this project has following modules.
* first_steps: dictionary, function declarations, imports, if-elif-else, lamdas. My first Python script.
